## Inspiration and Technical Challenges

### Inspiration
Growing up, my mornings always began with the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee, setting a positive tone for the day. This passion for coffee inspired me to create TrustedCoffee, a platform where users can easily find and purchase their favorite coffee products.

### Technical Challenges
One of the most significant challenges was resolving GLIBC compatibility issues using Docker. This involved containerizing the application to ensure smooth deployment across various environments. You can read more about this in my detailed [blog post](link_to_blog_post).
